/**
 * # Read-write list
 *
 * Implement methods in `ReadWriteList` class so that multiple threads could read data at the same time
 * as long as thereâ€™s no thread that is updating the data. Only one thread can update the data at a time
 * causing other threads (both readers and writers) to block until the update is over.
 *
 * Use `ReadWriteLock` implementation for this purpose.
 *
 * In your solution you should lock and unlock `read` and `write locks` in order to fulfill
 * the conditions above.
 * Remember to use `try-finally` construct - you want to release the lock
 * even if the operation with the underlying `list` was not successful.
 *
 * You can run `main()` to check your solution.
